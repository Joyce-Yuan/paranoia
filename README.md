#We created our project in hopes of bringing friends together to enjoy this fun party game! Although usually played with a group of friends in person, our platform is designed to keep everyone connected even through the pandemic. 

# Currently, we only have code for a command line tool. We are working on getting the code running on a local server with pygame, and eventually connecting it to a web-based server.

Rules:

You must have a minimum of 4 people to play this game.

Everyone will input their names and gather around in a (virtual) circle. 

The person starting the round will secretly ask his/her neighbor a question starting with "Who". 
(i.e. "Who is the most likely to die first in a zombie apocalypse?".

The person being asked will pick a person among the other friends.

The pair described above will rock paper scissors:
  If the person who answered the question wins, the question will not be revealed.
  If the person who was chosen wins, the question is revealed to everyone.
  
The turn continues, the person who was previously asked a question will ask his/her neighbor, and so forth.
